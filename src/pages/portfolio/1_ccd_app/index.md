It is the official app for fans of India's largest coffee chain (Cafe Coffee Day). It lets customers place an order at their favorite store, way before stepping into the café. They can choose their favorite item(s) and conveniently pay for their orders right from the app. It operates in all CCD stores in India and takes customer orders via its mobile app. it has been featured in both the IOS App Store and Google Play Store and has over 1 million downloads. I was the primary developer of this project, which was built with React Native. Worked on all phases of the project: development, identifying areas for improvement, testing, production support, maintenance, deployment etc.
