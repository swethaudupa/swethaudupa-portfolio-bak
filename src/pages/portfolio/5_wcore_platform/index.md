A scalable event-based platform which allows company's Applications to reside within the Enterprise Applications ecosystem. It lets all teams expose their data through services interface and was built for addressing business needs. Got an opportunity to learn how a GraphQL server works, by defining a GraphQL schema for the server and writing corresponding resolver functions. Managed to build a GraphQL server for company's core platform using NodeJS.
