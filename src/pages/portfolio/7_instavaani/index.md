instaVaani, a company's product, is a high-speed polling technology which conducted more than 200+ polls including web survey. It automatically contacts respondents at scale, and instantly collates results. It provides immediate snapshots of audience sentiment / favorability, across a representative or predefined sample of the population. instaVaani can also be deployed for outbound messaging. Responsibilities included talking to clients,understanding their requirements, script preparation, poll creation, audio edition, poll execution, result analysis using excel, making ppt for the clients. I also worked on Designing, developing and maintaining the instaVaani website using an editor called wix.
