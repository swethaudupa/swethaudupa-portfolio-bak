I wanted to play around with Firebase Auth, so I made this simple boilerplate project. The user can Login, Logout and Register. After being logged in, the user has to verifiy is email in order to see protected pages. The user can also re-send the verification email if he deleted it, he can recover his password, and edit his account details. It's also possible for the user to Login/Register using his Google Account.
