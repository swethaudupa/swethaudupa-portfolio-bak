A Voice of the customer (VOC) project, which included capturing and leveraging customer identity, explicitly and implicitly. Consequently, personalizing engagement with customers. Capturing feedback from customers and leveraging it, to improve store experience and retention. Worked in a team of two creating new features and functionality using ReactJS framework with GraphQL on server side.
