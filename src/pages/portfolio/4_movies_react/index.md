A Movie Library made with React. This was my first project after finishing a React Course. It fetches information from an API, and displays it in a nice way. You also get recommended movies based on the one you're watching, and you can also click on an Actor, and check information about him/her as well as movies that same actor enters. it uses React Router, and fetches the movie based on the URL, so you can easily reload the page and the data will be still fetched. It also uses lazy loading on images, has error handling, and uses Redux to manage state(even tho I realize now with more experience that I probably didn't needed it). One of the projects I'm most proud of.
